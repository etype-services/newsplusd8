<p>We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and we are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of circumstance and ability.</p><p>To fulfill this goal, we aim to adhere as closely as possible to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps provide a site that is accessible to all people.</p><p>This website is scanned regularly to confirm that the site elements and the content are in compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards.</p><p>This website utilizes various technologies all meant to make it more accessible. We utilize a toolbar that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s user interface and design to their personal needs. This interface replaces the previous method of one size fits all.</p><p>The tool bar helps accessibility:</p><ol><li>Font Handling – users can increase and decrease the size, change the font family, adjust spacing, line height and more.</li><li>Color Handling – users can select various color contrast profiles such as light and dark and backgrounds.</li><li>Text to speech - The toolbar offers users the ability to have the site read aloud. It also allows the users to tab through the navigation.</li><li></ol><p>Our goal is the support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies possible, so users can choose the best fitting tools for them. Our goal is minimal limitations for all users.</p><p>Despite our best efforts to allow adjustment to the sites, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible. We are constantly improving the accessibility of the site and the intent is to reach the optimal level of accessibility.</p><p>If you have discovered a page or element that does not allow access or have ideas that might help us improve access to the site, we would be happy to hear from you.
